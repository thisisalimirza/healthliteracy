The Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) was developed and validated by Parker et al. (1995) as documented in their research paper ["The test of functional health literacy in adults: a new instrument for measuring patients' literacy skills"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8576769/). The study demonstrated that TOFHLA is a valid, reliable indicator of patient ability to read health-related materials.
